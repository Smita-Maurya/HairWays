# HairWays
#OUR PROBLEM STATEMENT IS:

Human hair is considered a waste material in most parts of the world. Half of the masses consider human hair useless and often dump it as municipal waste. Many industries rely on hair as a key raw material, yet it is often overlooked. The inability to transport raw material to the designated location is a huge issue.

#PROPOSED SOLUTION

Our goal is to create a website that's serves as a bridge between salons and industries , connecting them for mutual benefits. Our plan is to collect the waste hair from engaged and interested salons. We will then proceed to categorize the hairs based on their qualities, texture and length. We then plan to cater to the hair needs of industries by offering a variety of textures and lengths, with hair serving as the primary source material for our supply. We will rate the hair according to the industrie's requirements based on the quality they need.

#OUR TARGET USERS ARE: '

1.WIG MAKING INDUSTRIES: Human hair possesses a versatile quality that makes it suitable for cleaning and utilization in creating various beauty hair accessories such as artificial wigs, eyelashes, hair extensions, beards, and moustaches. The industry that manufactures such products has emerged as one of the largest and most expansive global human hair industries. The enduring demand for wigs, beards, and moustaches spans several generations and cultures. Moreover, the use of fake eyelashes has become a popular practice in the entertainment and fashion industry, serving as an effective means of enhancing the aesthetic appeal of one's facial features.

2.MEDICAL INDUSTRIES: With approximately 20 amino acids present in a single human hair strand, hydrolysis of hair is a valuable means of extracting certain amino acids that have significant medicinal properties. Of note are the good yield of L-valine, L-leucine, L-cysteine, and L-isoleucine from human hair. L-cysteine, in particular, has several chemical derivatives that have potential applications in the formulation of pharmaceutical products and cosmetics. Moreover, Asian hair has been found to have a higher concentration of L-cysteine compared to other hair types, due to the predominance of black hair in that region.

3.MAKING FEBRIC: Human hair's exceptional tensile strength and durability make it a highly suitable material for fabric production. In the Arunachal Pradesh region of India, skilled artisans blend human hair with yak hair, cotton, and nettle fiber to create exquisite fabrics. Typically, human hair is used as the weft, while cotton yarn serves as the warp in these traditional weaving techniques. Fascinatingly, in Panipat, India, animal fibers are blended with cut-out human hair to produce blankets. The human hair industry has made significant contributions to the Indian economy and the global textile industry.

4.MANURE MAKING: Hair trimmings that are typically discarded after haircuts can be effectively repurposed as crop fertilizer. The human hair collected from barbershops and hair salons can serve as a valuable nutrient source for plants when combined with other compost materials.According to estimates, one kilogram of human hair can yield approximately 200 grams of melanin, 360 grams of keratin, and 300 milliliters of ionic liquid, which has the potential for use as a fertilizer. The crude form of melanin has already been successfully extracted, and further refinement to remove sulfur could significantly increase its value and market price.

OTHRES: The unique properties of human hair, such as its texture and thermal insulation, make it an ideal material for use in the manufacturing of stuffed toys and household items such as cushions. Additionally, excess human hair is commonly utilized in laboratory testing for these products. Moreover, mats produced using human hair have been found to be highly effective in controlling oil spills. The human hair industry has made significant contributions to the Indian economy and the global many big insdustries

#LABORATRY: Our company is dedicated to providing high-quality hair products to our customers. In order to ensure that we are meeting our customers' specific needs, we will be collaborating with small scale laboratories to conduct rigorous testing and analysis of our hair materials. This testing will involve evaluating the quality, texture, and other characteristics of the hair, and sorting it into distinct categories based on these attributes. By doing so, we will be able to offer our customers a streamlined and efficient process for ordering the precise raw materials that their company requires. Our commitment to quality and attention to detail in this process will enable us to continue providing exceptional hair products to our valued customers.

#IMPLEMENTATION: We plan to create a website utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Our first step will be to design the home page, which will comprises of various sections including raw product providers (salons) a dedicated section for consumer industries, and a separate area for our employees. Once the salon has entered its information and location, a transportation boy will immediately be appointed to collect the waste hair from that salon with the help of the location tracker. Then the transportation boy will be bringing the waste hair to the nearest warehouse. Afterwards, the hair will undergo evaluation by skilled professionals who will classify the hair based on criteria such as quality, texture, length etc. Based on the demand from various industries that use hair as a raw material, we will arrange for transportation accordingly.

#REVENUE: The investment required for raw materials will be minimal as waste human hair is a sustainable resource that is readily available and of high quality in India. To minimize initial costs, we will be renting existing warehouses and small laboratories. Our recruitment strategy will involve hiring local delivery personnel with basic phone and tracking system skills. Once the business becomes profitable, we plan to establish our own warehouse and laboratories staffed by trained professionals.

#FUTURE SCOPE: In the future, we plan to create an app and increase the number of warehouses to minimize the travel distance for our delivery person to acquire raw materials. It would also help us to expand our connectivity. As part of our expansion strategy, we are putting a strong emphasis on exporting Indian hair globally. Indian hair is highly sought after due to its premium quality and luxurious texture, making it a valuable and lucrative product in the international market.
